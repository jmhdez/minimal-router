Minimal Router
==============

Minimal Router is a very simplistic router for client-side Javascript applications. It's based on two principles:

* A router must be independent of another framework/libraries, so it must work with plain javascript objects and functions, not React components, AngularJS controllers o similar abstractions.

* A router must be independent of navigation and history APIs, so it just needs to be able to register router and dispatch (i.e. invoke) route handlers.

There is a more detailed description of the rationale behind router in this [design post](http://blog.koalite.com/2016/03/disenando-un-router-para-aplicaciones-spa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disenando-un-router-para-aplicaciones-spa) [Spanish only].

If you need a more complex/powerful router, or one integrated with your framework of choice, Minimal Router is not for you. Don't worry, there are plenty of other options to choose from.
